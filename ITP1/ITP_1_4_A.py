"""
Write a program which reads two integers a and b, and calculates the following values:

a รท b: d (in integer)
remainder of a รท b: r (in integer)
a รท b: f (in real number)
Input
Two integers a and b are given in a line.

Output
Print d, r and f separated by a space in a line. For f, the output should not contain an absolute error greater than 10**-5.
