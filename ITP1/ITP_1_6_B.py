Finding Missing Cards
Taro is going to play a card game. However, now he has only n cards,
even though there should be 52 cards (he has no Jokers).

The 52 cards include 13 ranks of each of the four suits: spade, heart, club and diamond.

Input
In the first line, the number of cards n (n â‰¤ 52) is given.

In the following n lines, data of the n cards are given. Each card is given by a pair of a character
and an integer which represent its suit and rank respectively. A suit is represented by 'S', 'H', 'C' and 'D' for spades,
hearts, clubs and diamonds respectively. A rank is represented by an integer from 1 to 13.

Output
Print the missing cards. The same as the input format,
each card should be printed with a character and an integer separated by a space character in a line.
Arrange the missing cards in the following priorities:

Print cards of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds in this order.
If the suits are equal, print cards with lower ranks first.
